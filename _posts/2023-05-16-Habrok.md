Habrok is a Discord bot whose purpose is to add a reputation system to a Discord server, while keeping it simple, easy to use, and respecting the privacy of the users.

# Why ?

I'm an admin of a somewhat large Discord server, so I regularly make Discord bots to help the moderation.

Habrok is the solution I came up with to solve the problem of people reportig someone without proof. While the bot is not an absolute solution, it's a tool that provides an "overall" reputation from the community.

The administrator of a Discord server can allow sharing the reputation of a member to other servers, so that the reputation of a member can be shared between servers.
