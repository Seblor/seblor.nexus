Stream Watcher is a Discord bot that creates a Discord event whenever a Twitch streamer goes live.

# Why ?

This bot was made for 2 purposes:

- For people who want to be notified when a streamer goes live, but don't want to be notified for every streamer they follow.
- For streamers who want to notify their community when they go live, but don't want to ping everyone.
