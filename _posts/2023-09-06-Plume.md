Plume is a Discord bot that logs the activity of voice channels. Basically it records everything that happens in the left bar of Discord and allows you to replay it in a neat browser interface ðŸŽ¨

# Why ?

I'm an admin of a somewhat large Discord server, so I regularly make Discord bots to help the moderation.

The one thing that was missing was a way to monitor the comings & goings of people in voice channels, to avoid false reports of people or get more context when there is a need of moderator intervention.

While working on the early version of Plume, I thought that I might as well make it public, so that other people can use it.

And since I didn't want to use a database for this Project anyway, it made it easy to keep a focus on privacy ðŸ”‘
